      You see that in the background? that's you for me. Today is all about you, so let me express my gratitude towards you, and for you. I am genuinely, so thankful for you. You are the biggest blessing of my life. Each memory we make together, will always be held at the very core of my heart. And each passing day, i will only love you more. You have become a core part of my life, a part of me, my soul. Thank you for being a part of my life aneeqah, the most important one too. Thank you for doing your best to make me happy, to lift me up when i am unhappy, to support me through thick and thin. You are a blessing, and truth be told, i want to be like you. I want to be as ambitious, as determined, and as kind hearted as you. I am so thankful for you. I love you so much. - Forever Yours, Ali Qasim.
